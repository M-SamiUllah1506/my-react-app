ðŸ’¡ React Components & State Management
I have hands-on experience building modular and reusable components using React. I work with both functional and class-based components, with a strong focus on:

Managing local component state using useState

Updating UI dynamically based on state changes

Passing props between components to create reusable and scalable interfaces

Using event handlers to control state updates (e.g., onClick, onChange)

Implementing basic interactivity like toggle switches, form handling, and conditional rendering
